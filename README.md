Dirty coding for sql conversion


 **ERD project sql convertor.**

While building a collection management system for the largest virtual museum - one has to be ambitions, right ðŸ¤” - I needed to quick compare some database designs and convert the sql file to sqlite format.
This script requires some extensive manual checking because many sql files have some interesting design concepts ðŸ™ˆ. For one thing enum conversion wonâ€™t work.
